    <h1>Lab 13: Security and Privacy Assessment of Ride-Hailing Service</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In this report are listed a couple of vulnerabilities that have been found in the server-vuln.js file hosted
        on https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/, together with their location in the code, their severity, description,
        proof of
        vulnerability and resolution.</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>Reading through the code and google-ing potential vulnerabilities. No tool has been used.</p>
    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    <p>First, there has been a Stored Cross-Site scripting vulnerability, which means that the input provided by an
        attacker to the source
        code can be malicious code that is stored in a database and later accessed by other users. This malware can
        retrieve sensitive
        data of the affected user such as login username and password. Second, there has been a SQL Injection, which
        means that
        the there was the danger of someone being able to interfere with the calls that the application makes to the
        database,
        and potentially obtaining more information than originally intended to be provided by the database.</p>
    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
    <div class="issue_div">
        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</p>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p><strong>Under the rides route (/rides)</strong>, line 27, where there is the INSERT query + <strong>under the
            root route (/ )</strong>, more specifically on lines 116 and 117, where the indexPage variable is updated.
        </p>
        <h3>Severity of issue</h3>
        <p>Since it is a stored XSS it is considered of a high or critical risk, as suggested by <a
                href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)"
                target="_blank">OWASP</a>.</p>
        <h3>Description of issue</h3>
        <p> Under the /rides route, the passenger table of the database gets updated with a username that is not
            verifies, which can easily be substituted by a script tag. Under the root route (/), the indexPage variable
            contains the
            HTML that will be displayed on the index page. Since this html is generated by concatenating html tags with
            the username obtained from the passenger table, the script tag introduced earlier might obtain sensitive
            data from the user accessing the root route.</p>
        <h3>Proof of vulnerability</h3>
        <p>
            In the terminal, executing
        <div class="w3-panel w3-card w3-light-grey">
            <div class="w3-code notranslate">
                curl -d 'username=&lt;script&gt;SOMETHING BAD&lt;script&gt;&lat=62&lng=70'
                https://jordan-marsh.herokuapp.com/
            </div>
        </div>
        will make the web server store the username, lat and lng provided by an attacker in the database. Later, if an
        user accesses the
        root route, and the server will successfully execute the following code
        <div class="w3-panel w3-card w3-light-grey">
            <div class="w3-code notranslate">
                for (var count = 0; count < result.rows.length; count++) { <br>
                indexPage += "&lt;li>" + result.rows[count].username + " requested a vehicle at " +
                result.rows[count].lat + ", " + result.rows[count].lng + " on " + result.rows[count].created_on + "&lt;/li>";<br>
                }
            </div>
        </div>
        then the attacker's script will be executed in the user's browser and possibly obtain sensitive data.
        </p>
        <h3>Resolution</h3>
        <p>To solve this issue, the developer of the web server should check for the validity of the username under the
            /rides route, so that it doesn't include script tags or other non-valid characters. Other measures include:
        <ul>
            <li>Using frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design, such as the latest Ruby on Rails, React JS.
                Learn the limitations of each framework’s XSS protection and appropriately handle the use cases which
                are not covered.
            </li>
            <li>Escaping untrusted HTTP request data based on the context in the HTML output (body, attribute,
                JavaScript, CSS, or URL) will resolve Reflected and Stored XSS vulnerabilities. The OWASP Cheat Sheet
                ‘XSS Prevention’ has details on the required data escaping techniques.
            </li>
            <li>Applying context-sensitive encoding when modifying the browser document on the client side acts against
                DOM XSS. When this cannot be avoided, similar context sensitive escaping techniques can be applied to
                browser APIs as described in the OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘DOM based XSS Prevention’.
            </li>
            <li>Enabling a Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth mitigating control against XSS. It is
                effective if no other vulnerabilities exist that would allow placing malicious code via local file
                includes (e.g. path traversal overwrites or vulnerable libraries from permitted content delivery
                networks).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Issue</h3>
        <p>SQL Injection</p>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Under the /passenger.json and the /vehicle.json routes.</p>
        <h3>Severity of issue</h3>
        <p>It can be a very severe issue since, according to <a
                href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection"
                target="_blank">OWASP</a>, injection can result in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized
            parties, loss of accountability, or denial of access. Injection can sometimes lead to complete host
            takeover. </p>
        <h3>Description of issue</h3>
        <p>Under the /passenger.json, since usernameEntry can be provided by an attacker and its validity is not checked
            anywhere, it will be combined with an SQL query later under the same route. The usernameEntry, instead of
            containing a valid username, it might contain a part of a SQL command. This might cause disclosure of data
            of other users.</p>
        <h3>Proof of vulnerability</h3>
        <p>An attacker could send a username in the request that is "username'OR1=1--", which will result in the SQL
            query being

        <div class="w3-panel w3-card w3-light-grey">
            <div class="w3-code notranslate">
                SELECT * FROM passengers WHERE username = 'username' OR 1=1--;
            </div>
        </div>
        since it will most probably happen that the username is not in the database, the second condition after the
        OR will be verified, which
        is always true. Thus, the database will return all the rows in teh database, hence revealing all the data in
        the passengers table to the attacker.
        </p>
        <h3>Resolution</h3>
        <p>Preventing injection requires keeping data separate from commands and queries.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>The preferred option is to use a safe API, which avoids the use of the interpreter entirely or provides
                a
                parameterized interface, or migrate to use Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs).
                Note: Even when parameterized, stored procedures can still introduce SQL injection if PL/SQL or T-SQL
                concatenates queries and data, or executes hostile data with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE or exec().
            </li>
            <li>Use positive or “whitelist” server-side input validation. This is not a complete defense as many
                applications require special characters, such as text areas or APIs for mobile applications.
            </li>
            <li>For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that
                interpreter. Note: SQL structure such as table names, column names, and so on cannot be escaped, and
                thus user-supplied
                structure names are dangerous. This is a common issue in report-writing software.
            </li>
            <li>Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of SQL
                injection.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, I could fing 2 vulnerabilities, one XSS and a SQL injection. Each one of them are vulnerabilities
        that can be prevented. However,
        if not prevented can cause great damage, including data loss and remote code execution on the victim's browser
        such as stealing credentials.</p>
