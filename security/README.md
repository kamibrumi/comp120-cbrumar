# Lab 13: Security and Privacy Assessment of Ride-Hailing Service

## Camelia D. Brumar

### Aspects of the work that have been implemented correctly

- Wrote an introduction, methodology, abstract of findings and conclusion for the report.
- Found a couple of web vulnerabilities.
- For each one of them, wrote a technical analysis.
- Styled the index.html file.
- I learned how to reference html tags in html by using &lt; for < and &gt; for >.

I only missed one of the vulnerabilities. I tried using some online tools such as 
- Burp Suite -- I tried to learn how to use it but it seemed pretty complex to use.
- SUCURI
- Qualys
- Quttera
- Intruder
- UpGuard
- SiteGuarding
- Observatory
- Web Cookies Scanner
- Detectify
- Probely -- this one and the above ones were providing few/vague info about the vulnerabilities.
- Pentest-Tools -- Somehow I used all my free uses before I could store the results of the analysis (Oops!).
