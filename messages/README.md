## Camelia D. Brumar

## Aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented and what have not

- I parsed the JSON data as instructed in the lesson.
- I modified the JavaScript function loadMessages to parse the JSON data, 
and outputed the messages with corresponding usernames in the "messages" 
section of the HTML, as ordered in JSON file.
- I also served my html page locally by running Python's simple HTTP server in 
the folder of my work
- The outputs  don't exist in JavaScript console.
- I did not modify the existing HTML.
- I did not use jQuery.
I believe I followed all the steps the professor provided and I have implemented everything that was mentioned in the assignment statement.
