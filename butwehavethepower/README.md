# LAB 6: Union Strike Folk Song
## Camelia D. Brumar

### Aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented and what have not

- Used JavaScript to annotate the video with 
the lyrics of the song inside the 
`<div id="lyrics">`, line by line or by verse.
- Provided some styling for the page via style.css.
- I appended a new paragraph element and text to
the lyrics div dynamically from JavaScript.
- I did not use jQuery.
- I did not use WebVTT.
- There are no errors nor outputs from `console.log` statements
in the JavaScript console.
I believe I followed all the steps the professor provided and I have implemented everything that was mentioned in the assignment statement.
